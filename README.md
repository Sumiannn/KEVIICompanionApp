An application targetted at helping King Edward VII residents be in the know about what is happening around the hall. It also serves as a platform for residents to check availability or book facilities in the hall. 

## Motivation

As residents of KEVII, we hope to have an integrated environment where we can access any hall information with a few swipes on our phones. We believe that there is potential to make KEVIIans' lives more comfortable and convenient through a residential application. This also has the potential to provide a lot more transparency in the hall.
